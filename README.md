# WRF Memory Experiments
This repository contains the Fortran code and runtime files to run the fixed-macrostate and memory-reset experiments in WRF. The repository also includes the code implementation of the ORG scheme in WRF (adapted from the version developed by Mapes and Neale 2011 in CAM). 

The default WRF code base (version 4.0.2) can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/coecms/WRF/tree/V4.0.2/WRFV3
